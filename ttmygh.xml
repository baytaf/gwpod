<p>For some time, I’ve been wanting to chat to Demetri about a concept he laid out for me in a conversation dating back to January 2020 when I appeared as a guest on his show – financial nihilism.</p>

<p>In the intervening months, that concept has continuously strengthened its grip on my mind as we’ve seen the world lurch from one crisis to another against a backdrop of YOLO and wanton gambling amongst market participants.</p>

<p>What follows is an intimate and deeply insightful conversation with a man who spends far too much time on one side of the mic, and not nearly enough on the other.</p>

<p>Hopefully this will begin to redress that balance.</p>

The SPAC phenomenon, the importance of volatility and the most recent Tesla results all come under Josh’s watchful eye, as do cryptocurrencies, the problems faced by pension funds starved of yield and the shifting geopolitical tectonic plates which pose grave threats to the decades of stability enjoyed by East and West alike.

Finally, there's a look at the potential explosion of activity in a coming together of  two worlds which were made for each other - sextech.

<p>Bill and Grant welcome Gerard Minack of Minack Advisors in Sydney to The End Game to discuss certain 'issues' Gerard took with some of the points made by previous guests in the series.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Gerard concurs about the importance of the inflation vs. deflation debate, but has a few important, idiosyncratic ideas of his own to include in the discussion.</p>

<p>What follows is yet another thought-provoking conversation guaranteed to have you reconsidering much you already thought to be true.</p>

<p>If Gerard is right and the strike price on the Fed Put has been lowered - possibly dramatically - it's time to reassess many strategies that have worked reliably for investors for decades.</p>

In this conversation, we discuss the book 1931: debt, crisis and the rise of Hitler and try to better understand historical parallels that echo loudly in the present.

The seemingly inevitable path to yield curve control, the similarities and differences between Japan and the West and the likely consequences of unfettered stimulus all come under the microscope in what I found to be another truly eye-opening discussion - one that showcases Luke at his brilliant best.</p>

                      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this special preview, Grant and Bill welcome Jim Stack of InvesTech Research to The End Game for a fascinating conversation about how Jim sees The End Game playing out.

From the outcome desired this time around by the Federal reserve to the results the last time they blew an epic, speculative bubble in the late-1990s, Jim explains where his technical signals suggest we are in the process, what he’s looking for to suggest the party may finally be winding up and why tenure in the investment industry is going to be hugely important in the months to come.

Jim runs through his proprietary indicators, explains why he pays little attention to sentiment indicators and offers some hope for a smooth transition from the everything bubble to something resembling normalcy (whatever that is these days)...

With so much polarization around this topic, it seemed like a good opportunity to try and flesh out the case both for and against bitcoin with two men who've become vocal proponents for their respective causes.

What followed was a wonderful exchange of ideas with both Mike and Nic demonstrating precisely why each side of the debate values their opinion so highly.</p>

<p>Will  any minds be changed by this? It's highly unlikely... but let's see, shall we?

In the first of yet another random series of conversations, Grant welcomes TC to the podcast to discuss the recent edition of TC's Chartcast featuring Tesla whistleblower, Karl Hansen.

TC explains how that episode came about, his thoughts on Karl's story and the broader implications of continuing poor behaviour by bad actors and regulators alike against a backdrop of increasing corporate malfeasance.

Thoughtful, considered and compelling, TC shares tales of his own harassment since a social media experiment became a Twitter phenomenon and offers thoughts on what happens next.</p>

<p>Confirmation bias for bears, kryptonite for bulls but, in the middle, for those willing to listen, lies great importance for all.</p>

<p>Using examples from the 1690s, 1930s and 1970s, Russell makes the case for inflation in the United States hitting 4% before the end of the year and explains why recent moves by the U.S. government to circumvent the Federal Reserve have changed the game dramatically and, potentially, bring The End Game much closer.

Russell offers a primer on real financial repression and explains how dangerously different the world may look in the not-too-distant future.</p>
